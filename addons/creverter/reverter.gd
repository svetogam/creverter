class_name CReverter
extends RefCounted
## The main class for the Composite Reverter, a memento-based undo/redo utility.
##
## [CReverter] (Composite Reverter) is an object that manages undo, redo,
## and related functions.
## It supports composing mementos together, so that different subsystems
## can handle their own saving and loading independently of each other
## while still operating in unison.
## [br][br]
## [b]Basic Usage:[/b][br]
## 1. Make a new reverter object with [method CReverter.new].
## [br]
## 2. Connect functions for building and loading mementos with [method connect_save_load].
## [br]
## 3. Save points in history with [method commit].
## [br]
## 4. Use the other methods to traverse the [member history].

## Emitted after a new memento is saved via [method commit].
signal saved
## Emitted after an old memento is loaded.
signal loaded

## Constant naming the tag in [member history]
## used to keep track of the cursor.
const CURSOR_TAG: StringName = "_CRCursor"
## Resource for keeping track of the history.
## It starts empty and mementos are added to it by calling [method commit].
## It can be accessed for extra functionality, but this is not necessary
## for most common uses of the [CReverter].
var history: CRHistory
## Signifies the current position of the [CReverter]
## in the [member history].
## The cursor is kept track of in the history using a tag named by
## [constant CURSOR_TAG]. Trying to set it to outside the history will
## clamp it inside.
## [br][br]
## [b]Warning:[/b] This is automatically set when using methods
## like [method undo], so don't use this unless you know what you're doing.
var cursor: int:
	set = set_cursor,
	get = get_cursor
# connections struct: {id_1: {"save_func": save_func, "load_func": load_func}, ...}
var _connections: Dictionary = {}


# Putting this in the constructor helps clean the automatic documentation.
func _init() -> void:
	history = CRHistory.new()


## Call this before calling [method commit].
## It connects save/load methods to the [CReverter] which will be used
## to build and load mementos.
## This can be called multiple times to track multiple save/load methods.
## [br][br]
## [param id] gives the id that combines the given save and load methods.
## Getting the id from [method Object.get_instance_id] is a good choice.
## [br][br]
## [param save_func] should be a method that returns either a [Dictionary]
## or a [CRMemento]-derived class.
## It will be called upon [method commit] to build the memento.
## [br][br]
## [param load_func] is the method that will be called with the same
## object as previously returned by [param save_func] as its first parameter.
## It will be called when loading, so it should handle setting things
## according to the memento.
## [br][br]
## Example: [code]
## reverter.connect_save_load(get_instance_id(), _build_memento, _load_memento)[/code]
## [br][br]
## [b]Warning:[/b] Calls will be ignored if the [member history] is not empty
## or if the given [param id] is equal to a previously given one.
## [br][br]
## [b]Warning:[/b] If [param save_func] or [param load_func] are
## methods on [Node]s that are freed or removed from the [SceneTree],
## then they will stop being operational.
## The [CReverter] will not add the nodes again back to the tree.
## Instead it will attempt to continue running while ignoring
## the removed nodes.
## It is therefore recommended to give for [param save_func] and
## [param load_func] methods on objects with the same expected
## lifetime as the [CReverter], representing whole subsystems
## instead of individual nodes in a subsystem.
